## About me

I studied architecture at a university and also get a Ph.D. degree in the field of theory of architecture. The most advanced design practices in architecture require knowledge of programming. During the design process, I always tried to optimize design decisions and automate routine jobs via programming. Over time coding itself became more and more interesting for me, and I had decide to improve my skills in this area and become a developer.
